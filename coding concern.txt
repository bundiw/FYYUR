  Sample code to update a record
  
  venueForm = VenueForm(request.form)
    err_message = null
    err = False

    seek_talent = False
    try:
        seek_talent = True if request.form['seeking_talent'] == 'y' else False

    except:
        pass

    finally:

        try:
  
  try:

      venue = Venue()
      db_venue = session.query(Venue).get(venue_id)
      venueForm.populate_obj(venue)
      db_venue.name = venue.name
      db_venue.city = venue.city
      db_venue.state = venue.state
      db_venue.address = venue.address
      db_venue.phone = venue.phone
      db_venue.genres = venue.genres
      db_venue.facebook_link = venue.facebook_link
      db_venue.image_link = venue.image_link
      db_venue.website_link = venue.website_link
      db_venue.seeking_talent = seek_talent
      db_venue.seeking_description = venue.seeking_description

      session.commit()
      
      
      The above code is used to update a record, my question is :
      On populating form value from venueForm into venue obj as (venueForm.populate_obj(venue))
      Is there a way we can update the venue object without extracting every column at a time like
      do the language suport object initialisation by directly assigning the object with similar object term of structure??
      
      Thank you.
